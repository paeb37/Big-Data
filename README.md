# Big-Data
Data Science Hackathon: data & privacy project
We tested a gauss model and a neural network to generate synthetic data from a dataset. Then we compared the mean, median, and standard deviation of our synthetic data with the original dataset. We found that the gauss model performed better than the neural network.
